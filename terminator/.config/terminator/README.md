# Why is this in my dot files?

I use terminator because it give a nice tiling interface to multi-terminals.

I develop many "microservices" and each needs a terminal where I can see the logs. So
I have layouts which bring up separate terminal windows running the various services.


## Why I stopped using terminator.

Creating custom layout has problems ...
1. Some sections are down right buggy
2. The config syntax is clunky

## What I use next
